Cloudglomerate
==============

The purpose of the project is to combine the different cloud storage options into one Java application.
This way the user can interact with all of their files in one place rather than going to various websites.
I hope to first integrate Box.com, Dropbox and Google Drive since there are Java SDKs available.

I hope to eventually abstract all of the accounts until they have just a cloudglomerate account and the app will take
care of choosing which service to upload to.  I also would like to have a web front as well as the java application.
Eventually filesystem integration would be best.
