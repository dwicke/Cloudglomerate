Cloudglomerate
==============

The purpose of the project is to combine the different cloud storage options into one Java application.
This way the user can interact with all of their files in one place rather than going to various websites.
I hope to first integrate Box.com, Dropbox and Google Drive since they provide Java SDKs.
